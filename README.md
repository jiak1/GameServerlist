# Game Server List Website

This website is designed to allow the public to post the IP's of their own game servers. The site allows anyone to find custom servers & get their details so they can play on them. It is [live here](https://minecraft.server-lists.com).

It also has a seperate administrator section that is used to approve new server listings & manage reports.
